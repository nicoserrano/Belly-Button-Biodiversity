# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
#### *Created an interactive dashboard to display bacteria that live inside the human body and are able to synthesize protein using Plotly.js and HTML/CSS.*

## Project Overview
This project consisted on creating a dashboard that displayed information about bacteria that live inside the human's belly button from a sample of hundreds of people. As it can be seen, the dashboard allows to visualize each person's demographic information, top 10 bacteria found, how frequently they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.
